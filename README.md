In this project there is two module are available.
1. User 
2. Admin

In this web i have used the breeze authentication system to login the admin (Sign up , Sign in , forgot password , logout). 
Admin can only login in web to create a post for the user .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also we created the api for user=> 

In this, user can login (I am using sanctum authectication) and register the account form api .
In this user can create a post. ALso user have facility to update and delete the own post.

Also user can comment on post which is created by the admin and view own post with comments by using api.


I will have implemented logic further in this project to better experience like as a ==> 
  === > In this project we have provide the list of address to admin and create the project with ip addrsss respect to address. 
 ===> when user can login on the landing page , user can see the all post by own address.

I can make this project better when i have much more time to do this.
Thank you.
